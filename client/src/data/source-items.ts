        "Reporters and members of the public outside of the Leonard Williams Justice Center where Dominion Voting Systems is suing Fox News in Delaware Superior Court today in Wilmington, Delaware. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\n\nA last-second settlement has been reached in Dominion Voting Systems’ historic defamation lawsuit against Fox News, the parties announced Tuesday in court.\n\n“The parties have resolved their case,” Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis said. “Your presence here… was extremely important. And without you, the parties would not have been able to resolve their situation,” the judge told the jurors, before dismissing them.\n\nThe settlement was apparently brokered while the trial was on the brink of opening statements in Wilmington, Delaware.\n\nAfter swearing in the jury earlier Tuesday, an unexplained hours-long delay paused proceedings in court, which yet again triggered rampant speculation that a deal was quietly in the works.\n\nWhat this means: The last-minute deal means the closely watched case is effectively over and won’t proceed to trial. By settling with Dominion, influential Fox News executives and prominent on-air personalities will be spared from testifying about their 2020 election coverage, which was filled with lies about voter fraud.\n\nDetails of the settlement were not immediately available and might never become public.\n\nMore on the case: In its lawsuit, Dominion sought $1.6 billion in damages from Fox News. The right-wing network argued vociferously in pretrial proceedings that this number was inflated and didn’t come close to accurately capturing the potential losses that Dominion could have suffered as a result of Fox’s 2020 broadcasts.\n\nFox News and Fox CorporaggVtion — its parent company, which was also a defendant — say they never defamed Dominion, and say the case is a meritless assault on press freedoms. They denied Dominion’s claim that they promoted these election conspiracies to save their falling ratings after the 2020 election.\n\nWhile the Dominion case is now over, Fox News is still facing a second major defamation lawsuit from Smartmatic, another voting technology company that was smeared on Fox shows after the 2020 election. That case is still in the discovery process, and a trial isn’t expected anytime soon.",

        'Justin Nelson, Dominion\'s lead counsel, appears on CNN. (CNN)\n\nDominion Voting Systems had two goals in its defamation case against Fox News — accountability and “trying to make Dominion whole," said Justin Nelson, the lead counsel election technology company.\n\nBoth were accomplished in this settlement, he told CNN on Tuesday.\n\nThe payment of more than $787 million by Fox News to Dominion and the network\'s statement acknowledging that its coverage of the 2020 election was false was “a strong message of accountability” and an important victory for the employees of his client\'s company.\n\n“This is really the first time that anyone has paid a price for telling the lies of the 2020 election and we\'re very proud about that," he said.\n\nWhile the settlement does not stipulate that Fox’s anchors must acknowledge the lies on air, Nelson said it was a consequential outcome for the network.\n\nThe texts and emails that emerged during the litigation process from inside the Fox network were valuable, he said. "And what today has shown is that you have to pay a price if you\'re telling lies."\n\nPrevious court filings revealed messages that showed that the most prominent stars and highest-ranking executives at Fox News privately ridiculed claims of election fraud in the 2020 election, despite the right-wing channel allowing lies about the presidential contest to be promoted on its air.\n\n“It’s a lot of what we teach our kids, which is that the truth does indeed matter, and if you are lying, eventually there\'s going to be consequences to that," Nelson said.\n\nHe said the settlement with Fox sends a "strong message" to other right-wing outlets in which Dominion has ongoing legal disputes.',

        "Sergei Lavrov speaks during a conference in Caracas, Venezuela, on April 18. (Pedro Rances Mattey/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov praised a framework introduced by China and Brazil, which proposed an end to the conflict in Ukraine.\n\n“We applaud the position from China, and we have also held talks with Brazil on this, and these are very useful proposals because they can help to share ideas and help resolve problems,” Lavrov said Tuesday during a news conference in Caracas, Venezuela. “All this, however, is not part of the West’s rules.”\n\nLavrov explained the West would not accept the so-called “peace proposal” that would see the Crimean Peninsula fully integrated into the Russian Federation.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukraine has repeatedly said peace in the conflict will only be achieved if Russia restores the country's borders and Kyiv takes back Crimea.\n\n“We hope the regime in Kyiv respects the rights of Crimea, we already know the West, it’s demanding that Crimea is returned,” Lavrov said.\n\nSince taking office this year, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has suggested his country could help broker a negotiation in the Russian invasion of Ukraine, arguing Kyiv should relinquish sovereignty claims over Crimea in exchange for the end of the conflict.\n\nLast week, Lula traveled to China and both countries reiterated calls for a peaceful solution to the conflict.\n\nLula has largely adopted a policy of non-intervention over the war in Ukraine, following in the same footsteps of many leaders in middle-income and developing countries.\n\nOn Saturday, Lula said the US and the EU need to start talking about peace between Ukraine and Russia.\n\n“The United States needs to stop encouraging war and start talking about peace; the European Union needs to start talking about peace so that we can convince Putin and Zelensky that peace is in the interest of everyone and that war is only interesting, for now, to the two of them,” Lula told reporters in Beijing on Saturday.\n\nSome context: The US and EU have been major suppliers of arms and aid to Ukraine amid Russia’s invasion.\n\nLavrov is in Caracas as part of a five-day trip to Latin America, visiting Brazil, Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua. On Tuesday, Lavrov criticized US sanctions on Venezuela and said Russia intends to strengthen diplomatic and commercial relationships with the Andean country.\n\nCNN's Tatiana Arias and Duarte Mendonca contributed reporting.",

        "CNN —\n\nA 34-year-old man was arrested Tuesday evening in connection with the killings of four people who were found dead earlier in the day at a Bowdoin, Maine, home, authorities said.\n\nThe killings appeared to be connected to a series of nearby highway shootings that left three drivers injured – including one critically – shortly after the four bodies were discovered, state police have said.\n\nThe man arrested was identified by Maine State Police as Joseph Eaton.\n\nEaton was taken to Two Bridges Regional Jail and will make an initial court appearance later in the week, state police said in a Tuesday evening news release. Officials said Wednesday that for the moment Eaton is only accused of the killings.\n\nCNN has not yet been able to identify an attorney for Eaton.\n\n“Investigators will be working throughout the night processing multiple scenes and continuing to interview people involved with this incident,” state police said in the news release.\n\nPolice have not shared details about a possible motive in the two incidents and did not share details about the four people found dead in the home.\n\nIn a statement on Twitter, Maine Gov. Janet Mills said, “Like people across Maine, I am shocked and deeply saddened – acts of violence like we experienced today shake our state and our communities to the core.”\n\nVehicles ‘hit by straight gunfire’\n\nMaine State Police responded Tuesday morning to the Bowdoin home, where they found the four deceased victims inside, state police Lt. Randall Keaten said in a news conference earlier Tuesday.\n\nShortly after, authorities received reports of several vehicles getting hit by gunfire on I-295 in the area of Yarmouth, which is about 40 minutes from Bowdoin.\n\nThree people were shot while driving and were taken to the hospital, state police said. At least one of those three was in critical condition Tuesday, authorities added.\n\n“We’ve got vehicles that have been hit by straight gunfire all across that we’re getting reports on, so if anybody has holes in their vehicles, please contact us so that we can follow up with that,” Keaten said.\n\nThe victims found in the Bowdoin home and the highway shootings are connected, Keaten said, adding there is no threat to the public.\n\nThe four bodies were taken to the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in Augusta where autopsies will determine the manner and cause of death state police said.\n\nAuthorities have asked anyone who may have witnessed something or has any information about the Tuesday morning incidents to reach out.\n\n“A lot happened this morning between those two scenes and those are the people that we want to talk to, those people that were impacted by this,” Keaten said, adding authorities were continuing to work on several impacted scenes and gather more information.",
